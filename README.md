## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/finai-assistant.git
    cd finai-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. You must create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add your API key to it.

    Create the `.env` file:
    ```sh
    touch .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    **Important:** The application is designed to load this key securely. Do not hardcode your key directly into the source code.

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and your API key is configured, you can start the development server.

Using npm:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Or using yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```
This will start the application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified).

## How to Use

-   **Navigation:** Use the sidebar on the left to switch between the different views like Dashboard, Portfolio, and Text Analyzer.
-   **Text Analyzer:** This is the core feature.
    -   Navigate to the "Text Analyzer" view.
    -   You can either use the suggestion chips to analyze a sample article or ask a question.
    -   Alternatively, paste any financial text into the input bar at the bottom and click send. The AI will provide a detailed analysis.
-   **Portfolio:**
    -   Navigate to the "Portfolio" view.
    -   Click "Add Asset" to add stocks to your portfolio by entering their ticker symbol and the number of shares.
    -   Your portfolio is saved locally in your browser.
-   **What-If Analysis:**
    -   After adding assets to your portfolio, go to the "What-If Analysis" view.
    -   Select a market scenario, adjust the parameters, and click "Run AI Simulation" to see the projected impact on your holdings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

-   `/src/components`: Reusable React components used across multiple views (e.g., Header, Sidebar, Message).
-   `/src/views`: Top-level components that represent each page or main feature of the application (e.g., Dashboard, Portfolio, TextAnalyzer).
-   `/src/services`: Modules responsible for external communication, primarily with the Gemini API (`geminiService.ts`) and for managing local data (`portfolioService.ts`).
-   `/src/types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for the main data structures used in the app.
